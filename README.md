# Snowflake ID Algorithm
The Snowflake algorithm is a unique identifier generation algorithm designed for distributed systems. It provides a way to generate globally unique IDs that are sortable by timestamp and can be used in distributed and multi-node environments. The algorithm was originally introduced by Twitter.

This repository contains an implementation of the Snowflake algorithm in Java, allowing you to generate Snowflake IDs for your distributed applications. The algorithm uses a combination of timestamp, worker ID, and sequence number to ensure uniqueness and ordering of generated IDs.

Key features:
-   It can satisfy the non-repetitive ID in the high concurrent distributed system environment.
-   High production efficiency.
-   Based on timestamps, ordered increments are guaranteed.
-   No dependencies on third-party libraries or middleware.
-   The generated id is sequential and unique.
